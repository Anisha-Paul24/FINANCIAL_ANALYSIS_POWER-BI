# Financial Analysis- POWER BI
   
This repository showcases a Power BI project that analyzes global financial performance, focusing on metrics like **sales**, **profit**, **cost of goods sold (COGS)**, and **discounts**. The entire workflow, including data cleaning and visualization, is executed within Power BI. The data was initially prepared in Excel (XLS format) and then used to build interactive dashboards for insightful analysis.
# MY PROJECT WORK
1. Open the Power BI project ZIP file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Explore the dashboards and adjust filters to analyze specific metrics or segments.

`).

### 2. Data Transformation
- Data cleaning and transformation were conducted using MS Excel tools:
  - Standardizing column names.
  - Parsing and formatting date columns to enable time-based analysis.
  - Calculating key metrics such as profit margin, gross sales, and total discounts.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Power BI dashboards and reports were created to highlight:
  - Monthly and yearly sales trends.
  - Profit margins by product, country, and segment.
  - Impact of discounts on sales and profitability.

   - Total Profit: `$16.89M`
   - Profit Margin: `$504.70`
   - United States and Canada were the top contributors to overall profit.

3. **Discount and COGS Analysis**:
   - Discounts of over 20% often resulted in reduced profitability.
   - Products with a high cost of goods sold (COGS) maintained consistent demand despite lower profit margins.

4. **Segment Performance**:
   - Government and Small Business segments dominated sales, contributing over 50% of total revenue.
